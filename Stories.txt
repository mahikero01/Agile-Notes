A sample Business Requirements	

The Globomantics Audio Refdeemer
Gobomantics has developed the next wave in audio excellence. No longer is your music 
doomed to a life in it's compact discdungeon, instead it can
finally be liberated to accompany you on all of your adventure, through the magic
of your portable player.

Here's how it works:
	1. An audiophile hungry for music liberation places their CD into the kiosk.
	2. They then plug their Portable Media Player into the kiosk's USB slot
	3. THe Kiosk automatically rips all of their CDs directly to their Portable MediaPlayer.
	
Requirements
	1. Users can insert any CD into the kiosk
		a. If the user likes we'll keep their CD and recycle it for them
	2. Users will plug their device into the kiosk.
	3. We can periodically empty the kiosk and pickup the CDs for recycling.
	4. We will charge a convenience fee for the process of ripping their music
		to their device. This fee will be paid by credit card.
	5. We can pull reports from the kiosk to see how it's doing.
		a. Usage reports
		b. Financial reports
		c. Diagnostic reports
