User Stories
	- Common to most agile methodologies
	- Popular with new teams
	- Large point of struggle
	
What is a story?
	1. Brief - Designed to encourage interaction
	2. High level - Allows you to defer details
	
What is not a story?
	1. Detailed requirements - Defers design to the responsible moment
	2. Set in stone - Designed to be flexible
	
A story - is a placeholder for a conversation.

The Story Format
	1. As a (position name),
		e.g. As a salesperson,
	2. I want to (wanted to do),
		e.g. I want to create a quarterly forecast,
	3. So that (reason for the said task).

A story must be an INVEST
	1. Independent - can stand on its own
	2. Negotiable - can be change and rewritten
	3. Valuable - the story has a value to the end user
	4. Estimate-able - the story must be small enought can be estimate when it can be finish
	5. Small - the story must to be able to complete
	6. Testable - the story can be testable for implmentation
	
	
Epics - set of stories that are related and considered as one big story	and must be 
deliverable as a whole

Qualities of Epics	
	1. Captures a complete workflow towards a goal
	2. Not deliverable until all stories are complete
	3. Can cater to multiple users

	
Themes - set of stories that are related and can be delivered individualy	
		
Qualities of Themes	
	1. Stories are related, or all serve a similar goal
	2. Do not need to encapsulate a workflow
	3. Can be delivered independently of one another
		
		
What are Roles?
	1. Represents groups of users - Rather than individual users
	2. Derived from the characteristics of the group - Based on the group'said
		interest in the system
			

Persona - a fictional character that represents a user of the application
		
Roles versus Personas
	Roles - Represent a group of users
	Personas - Represent individual users
			 - Creates a backstory for a role
			 - Differetiates between similar roles
			 
Which Roles should we create a Persona?
	1. Frequently used roles - Not all roles will become personas
	2. Relationship mapping - Who are the key users of the application
	
Advantage of Relationship Mapping
	1. Identify new users
	2. Highlights interactions between users
	3. Shows influence
	
Choosers versus Users
	1. Chooser - Those who are paying for the system
	2. Users Those who are using the system
		
Creating Personas
	1. Name
	2. Photo
	3. Role
	4. Description
	
In Addition
	1. Key Quote
	2. Professional Title
	3. User Demographics
	
Pitfalls when using Personas
	1. Using photos of celebrities - Free the team of preconceived notions
	2. Narrowly defining the backstory - Personas should expand a role, not limit it
	
		
Scrum Management Tool Terms.
	1. Current - curent items to working
	2. Backlog - next item to be work on
	3. Icebox - holding pen for task but not yet related to backlog for not to loose track
	4. Epics - large stories/task
	
2 Stories Management Tools	
1. Stikies notes properties
	a. More tangiable
	b. More flexible
2. Electronics Tools	
	a. Better for archiving stories

A sample Business Requirements	

The Globomantics Audio Refdeemer
Gobomantics has developed the next wave in audio excellence. No longer is your music 
doomed to a life in it's compact discdungeon, instead it can
finally be liberated to accompany you on all of your adventure, through the magic
of your portable player.

Here's how it works:
	1. An audiophile hungry for music liberation places their CD into the kiosk.
	2. They then plug their Portable Media Player into the kiosk's USB slot
	3. THe Kiosk automatically rips all of their CDs directly to their Portable MediaPlayer.
	
Requirements
	1. Users can insert any CD into the kiosk
		a. If the user likes we'll keep their CD and recycle it for them
	2. Users will plug their device into the kiosk.
	3. We can periodically empty the kiosk and pickup the CDs for recycling.
	4. We will charge a convenience fee for the process of ripping their music
		to their device. This fee will be paid by credit card.
	5. We can pull reports from the kiosk to see how it's doing.
		a. Usage reports
		b. Financial reports
		c. Diagnostic reports
